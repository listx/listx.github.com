# Put in the Arch Linux live CD and run the following commands...

# Set up 2 partitions; the first one is the boot 100MB partition (be sure
# to toggle the BOOT flag on it), and the second will be the LVM partition.
# Be sure to select 8E for the LVM partition! You can use
# /dev/disk/by-uuid/XXXX for more fine-grained control; use "blkid -o list"
# to find out which drives are given which UUIDs.

cfdisk /dev/sda

# Now set up encryption on the LVM partition (the 2nd partition, so it's
# /dev/sda2). It is recommended to use aes-xts-plain64 if the partition is
# larger than 2 TB, I think.

cryptsetup -c aes-xts-plain -y -s 512 luksFormat /dev/sda2

# Decrypt the encrypted partition with LUKS. We need to decrypt it first
# before setting up LVM volumes and filesystems on it. This will create
# an entry under /dev/mapper/luks.

cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda2 luks

# Set up LVM. We call our volume group "vg0". To be honest I am not sure if
# the "--contiguous y" option for swap matters because we are encrypting it
# (doesn't block encryption encrypt data randomly on the disk?), but that's
# what I found online and that's what I'll use here. The "+100%FREE" option
# is a very handy option that tells LVM to fill up all remaining free space,
# in this case, for the "home" logical volume.
# Read more about LVM on your favorite online wiki.

pvcreate /dev/mapper/luks
vgcreate vg0 /dev/mapper/luks
lvcreate --size 40G vg0 --name root
lvcreate --size 2G --contiguous y vg0 --name swap
lvcreate -l +100%FREE vg0 --name home

# Initialize filesystems. Btrfs is still experimental, so I choose ext4
# here. The vg0-root, vg0-home, and vg0-swap volumes should
# appear under /dev/mapper as you create them with the lvcreate command.

# Mount the logical volumes. Why? Because we need to install Arch Linux onto
# it! You probably don't need to mount the "home" volume but it couldn't
# hurt. Besides, it's nice to test that all volumes can be mounted OK anyway.
#
# NOTE: Mount order is important! YOU MUST FIRST MOUNT THE ROOT PARTITION into
# /mnt before creating more directories such as /mnt/boot, /mnt/home, etc. to
# mount the /boot, /home, and any other partitions.

# group name for the `-g` flag's argument in the `useradd` command below. I like
# to have 1-character usernames for my machines to keep things simple and short,
# as I will be the exclusive user of the system anyway, so I also use the same
# character for my group as well, so that, in particular, the `ls` command's
# full listing of my files looks very succinct, as I like to live in the
# terminal and use `ls` daily.

# Install boot loader. I like SYSLINUX because of the saner/easier-looking boot
# configuration file, compared to GRUB 2. Be sure to add in (as a single line)

# the encrypted LVM partition. Otherwise, your system won't boot! Don't forget
# to actually look up the UUID of your LVM partition (/dev/sda2 in this
# tutorial). To easily add in the long UUID of the disk, just concatenate it
# into the syslinux.cfg file with `blkid -o list >>
# /boot/syslinux/syslinux.cfg`, and edit as needed.

# You don't need to tell the kernel about your vg0-home volume because that will
