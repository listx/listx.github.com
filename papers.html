			<p>Here is a list of more serious writings. “Serious” here means anything that took me more than a few sittings to write and revise, as anything that takes less than that would most likely just get uploaded as a blog post.</p>
<h3 id="bitscans-and-de-bruijn-sequences-2014"><a href="http://linusarver.com/upload/grid/file/attachment/fyle/549e65206c30005598000000/debruijn-sequence-tutorial.pdf">Bitscans and De Bruijn Sequences (2014)</a></h3>
<p>I wrote this paper originally in 2011–2012, but it was not released until it was finally revised in 2014.</p>
<h3 id="haskell-for-newbies-tentative-title-coming-2015">Haskell for Newbies (tentative title, coming 2015)</h3>
<p>This will be a short PDF on getting started writing Haskell programs. The goal of the paper will be to introduce Haskell to beginners, and to explain things <em>without</em> any reference to mathematics dealing with category theory.</p>
