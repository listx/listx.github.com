<p>I got a pair of the famous AKG K702 (manufacturer refurbished for $210) fullsize headphones, and well, here’s my review. Previously, I was using the Nuforce NE600M (purchased new December 2012 for $30) earbuds. Comparing these two is unfair, because they are not really designed to compete with each other; however, I must say that I was shocked by how much better the K702s sounded. As a side note, I only use these headphones for my laptop/PC, and I always use the Total Bithead headphone amp/DAC.</p>
<h2 id="pros">Pros</h2>
<ul>
<li>Made in Austria.</li>
<li>The K702s have a very large <em>soundstage</em>. This is probably because of the open back design — the earcups have holes and allow some of the sound to leak out. I listen to a lot of classical music and this makes piano sonatas sound absolutely divine.</li>
<li>The highs and mids are very sharp and well-defined, allowing for good sound separation (I can hear different instruments much more easily in the same song).</li>
<li>The headphone cable is detachable.</li>
<li>The big earpads are comfortable, and also detachable for cleaning.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cons">Cons</h2>
<ul>
<li>The headband feels a little tight, and I can feel it pressing down on my head a little too much. Also, there is a clear plastic headband part on each side to secure the leather headband, but this component feels cheap and is prone to breakage down the line.</li>
<li>It’s not really a con, but the impedance is 62 ohms, which means you will need a dedicated headhpone amp/DAC (unless you want to turn the volume way up to get these headphones to really sing). If you are using a $200-$300 pair of headphones though, you probably already know about the need for a good amp/DAC combo, so that’s that.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I love my K702s. Interestingly, I have gotten used to a much louder volume with this pair of headphones than with my 600Ms. Let me explain. I usually listen to music on medium/low, but I can now listen to loud pop songs on high volume without any discomfort. I think it has something to do with the bigger sound stage (open back design, plus the way the speakers are physically further away from my eardrums).</p>
<p>My 600Ms don’t sound as clean and awesome as they used to; for one, they have too much bass and the sound feels very muddied, as if the sound is coming from another room with the door closed. I had no idea that a simple headphone upgrade could change my attitude to computer audio so much. Unfortunately, as much as I loved the 600Ms when I first got them, I can’t really stand them now…</p>
<p>I strongly recommend these headphones, or another similarly-priced model (the Beyerdynamic DT-770 is a longtime competitor) to anyone who has never invested more than $50 on a pair of headphones. You will definitely hear the difference, given a decent amp/DAC.</p>
