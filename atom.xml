<p>Happy 2016 everyone!</p>
<p>I thought I should update this blog, even though it’s taking time away from some really fun side hobbies/projects! This post breaks with the unspoken tradition on this blog, which is that every post should be something meaningful, with original content; but, I now think that I should use this space for more personal/opinion/meta things too, not just pure technical articles.</p>
<p>Anyway, below are some updates on various things going on in my life.</p>
<h1>Side projects</h1>
<p>I have a number of side projects all clamoring for my loving care. In years past, I would work on multiple projects at the same time, and start new ones even without finishing old ones. This year, I plan to just focus on one project at a time!</p>
<p>Currently, I am working on a computer keyboard layout optimizer, using the well-known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing">Simulated Annealing</a> algorithm. It’s a very interesting problem, and although currently my SA implementation lacks enough heuristics to make it perform any differently than random search, it is still fun to hack on. Once it is done, I will open-source it.</p>
<p>After that, I want to finish up the core features for a simple terminal-based password manager program. Making a GUI application, even console-based, is quite the challenge!</p>
<h2>Haskell book</h2>
<p>Eagle-eyed readers may have noticed that I silently pushed back timeframe for my <a href="http://funloop.org/papers.html#haskell-for-newbies-tentative-title-coming-2016">book</a> the Haskell programming language. I did this on purpose, because what with a new job and whatnot, I have not had the time as before to work on it. But, it is not dead, and I do intend to finish it — later this year!</p>
<h1>New hobbies</h1>
<p>I picked up a new hobby — the ancient game of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">Go</a>! I’ve been playing on my phone and even got myself some decent equipment, and I have to say that it is much more fun than chess (I say this as a former avid chess player). Maybe I’ll find a way to tie it into programming.</p>
<p>My brother gave me a rather expensive camera and I started to take some pictures with it, although I have yet to really put serious time into it. But I do know that it’s one of the first things I’m grabbing the next time I go on a trip.</p>
<h1>Retrospect</h1>
<p>Perhaps this section is a bit out of place, but I think I should mention the big highlights of 2015 for myself:</p>
<ul>
<li>I got hired at a <a href="http://www.twinprime.com/">fantastic tech company</a> (doing DevOps) and basically ended the self-imposed exile of staying out of the professional tech world</li>
<li>I moved to a new place (closer to work)</li>
<li>I bought a new car (truck!)</li>
<li>I learned a lot of new things (from work)</li>
</ul>
<p>. I should note that, before my current job, I had purposefully refrained from seeking professional positions in the tech sector because I had a fear that somehow my passion for programming would be lost. Thankfully, I can say that this fear was unfounded. Almost every day, after work and dinner, I sit and code (Haskell)!</p>
<h1>Onward</h1>
<p>I will be posting something at least once a month, I hope, to share some thoughts with you all. I thank all past, present, and future readers, for giving me the motivation to keep this blog alive!</p>

<p>I love <a href="https://github.com/jonas/tig">tig</a>. Still, I think the defaults aren’t the best for most developers. Here are two easy customizations to make the default view better.</p>
<p>First, put</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">alias</span> tig=<span class="st">&#39;tig -n 1000&#39;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>in your <code>~/.bashrc</code> to reduce tig’s startup time (especially on large repositories). There’s rarely a need to go back more than 1000 commits from your current HEAD position in an interactive, GUI-driven manner. And if you really need to see everything, do</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ \<span class="kw">tig</span></code></pre></div>
<p>on the terminal to bypass the shell alias.</p>
<p>Second, put the following in your <code>~/.tigrc</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>set main-view = date author id:width=10 commit-title:yes,graph,refs
</code></pre>
<p>. This makes the default view show git commit hashes (where <code>width</code> is the number of hex digits to show), so that you don’t have to press ENTER on a particular commit to see its hash.</p>
<p>Happy hacking!</p>

    <title>Why I Use NixOS</title>

	<code class="date">2015-08-01</code><a class="history" href="https://github.com/listx/listx_blog/commits/master/post/2015-08-01-why-i-use-nixos.org" title="History">*</a>
	<br>
	<a href="/tag/linux.html">linux</a>, <a href="/tag/arch.html">arch</a>, <a href="/tag/nix.html">nix</a>, <a href="/tag/nixos.html">nixos</a>
</div>

<p>Since March 2015, I’ve been using NixOS on my main desktop machine at home. I was on Arch Linux for 6~7 years before that. So, why did I switch?</p>
<h1>Arch Linux</h1>
<p>Let’s review the reasons I switched to Arch Linux in the first place. I switched to Arch Linux from Xubuntu because I did not want to do big distribution upgrades from one major version to the next. Arch Linux is based on a rolling release schedule — packages are updated on a daily basis. What people often say is that Arch is “bleeding edge”. While that is true, they don’t realize that at the same time, you can choose to do weekly or monthly upgrades (in an incremental fashion) rather than waiting six months or a year for a big fat distribution upgrade.</p>
<h2>System age</h2>
<p>The problem though, is that with age the system becomes increasingly confusing because of unused files/directories. You install packages, then delete them, but then your system still has traces of them left. I still have an old laptop with Arch on it dating from an earlier install probably about five years back (or more) — and the <code>$HOME</code> directory on there has a lot of dotfiles and other folders — some of which I have no clue about. <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> It’s not very different from the same feeling I got as a teenager looking at Windows XP’s <code>regedit.exe</code> and wondering what some of the registry keys did, or if they were used at all.</p>
<h2>Power user mindset</h2>
<p>Another problem is that Arch expects the user to understand their entire system from the bottom up! The culture is very much “RTFM”, but not only that, you are expected to sign up to the Arch mailing lists and also read the distro homepage on a regular basis. Dare I say it — the only reason the Arch Wiki is so well-regarded is because of this culture of “you must know everything”.</p>
<p>This is fine, but ultimately I believe that it is too much responsibility. For example, every once in a while, <code>pacman</code> generates copies of existing system files whenever they would get overwritten by newer ones. One example is the <code>/etc/group</code> file. Call me lazy but I never bothered learning about the ins-and-outs of this file and what the syntax means. But every Arch Linux user out there has to do a <code>vimdiff</code> against the old/new versions of this file and perform the correct changes (basically merge them), usually with the helper CLI tool called <code>yaourt</code> with its <code>-C</code> flag.</p>
<h2>Package confusion</h2>
<p>As you use Arch Linux, you invariably end up installing one package after another. Right now, there is no way to introduce some hierarchical system of organizing packages. For example, let’s say you install the <code>firefox</code> package because you want to use, well, Firefox! In <code>pacman</code>’s point of view, there is no difference between <code>firefox</code> and <code>libfoo</code>. I.e., high-visibility, userland packages like <code>firefox</code> are treated the same in all respects as <code>libfoo</code>. You can do clever things like have meta-packages, which are defined in terms of other packages (e.g., LibreOffice), but this kind of organizational structure is hard-coded at the <code>PKGBUILD</code> level. <a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>I’m sure there are <code>pacman</code> helper scripts/programs out there to give you a better, organized understanding of all of your installed packages. But do you really want to know that you have <code>libvdpau</code> installed, or that it needs to get updated? As you press <code>pacman -Syu&lt;ENTER&gt;</code>, do you really care about the exact names of the 50 low-level system packages that your userland programs (like Firefox) depend on?</p>
<h1>NixOS</h1>
<p>So what makes NixOS better?</p>
<h2>Pros</h2>
<p>First off, system age has no real bearing on NixOS. Because everything is done in a functional way with the Nix package manager, your <strong>entire system</strong> becomes “recreated” each time you decide to upgrade. By default, you cannot directly write to places like <code>/usr/share</code> or <code>/usr/local</code>. Essentially, anything outside of <code>$HOME</code> can only be manipulated via the Nix package manager. And Nix does an excellent job of keeping all system directories clean and stateless!</p>
<p>Second, you don’t have to hand-tune system files like <code>/etc/group</code>. The NixOS configuration file is where you define system-wide things like users and groups, and after you set it once, it’s done for good.</p>
<p>Third, you can either hard-code what packages get installed system-wide in your config file (<code>/etc/nixos/configuration.nix</code>), or you can define your own set of packages on top of the ones defined by the official NixOS Nix expression. I used to do the former, but now I do the latter; and all I do now to see what packages I have installed explicitly is invoke <code>nix-env -q</code>, and I get this:</p>
<pre><code>fontforge-20141230
ghc-7.10.1
l-set-av
l-set-base
l-set-dev
l-set-games
l-set-misc
l-set-office
l-set-vm
l-set-web
pavucontrol-3.0
source-code-pro-2.010
</code></pre>
<p>. Those <code>l-set-</code> packages are ones where I have defined a hierarchy — i.e., I’ve coded up Arch Linux’s version of meta-packages. What’s great is that it’s all done in a programmatic way using the Nix expression language. <a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The rest are official packages I chose to install. But basically this sure beats doing something like <code>pacman -Q</code>, which grabs all installed packages on the entire system.</p>
<p>Fourth, I really like how I can do a <strong>system</strong> upgrade without touching my explicitly-installed packages in my user’s Nix environment (<code>nix-env</code>). I can update my version of <code>firefox</code> as much as I like without touching low-level packages like Xorg or the kernel, or vice-versa. It gives me the flexibility of a “rolling release” distro without the stability issues.</p>
<p>Fifth, the heart of NixOS — the Nix package manager — works by looking at a single “master” Nix expression. So if you have any custom Nix expressions, they better play well with the other ones officially provided upstream by the NixOS team! In Nix, no package is an island; in a sense, it’s a lot like how FreeBSD keeps all of their packages in a single code repository to guarantee stability.</p>
<h2>Cons</h2>
<p>Granted, there are problems with NixOS. The biggest problem is the lack of adoption. It still has not hit critical mass, and most of the core contributors are overloaded with far too much work.</p>
<p>The second problem is that there is no way to do things like <code>make install</code> after you download the source code to some program <code>foo</code>. This is because NixOS does not have directories like <code>/usr/share</code> — the whole Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard is thrown out the window in favor of symlinks to the “compiled” Nix expressions. So, you have to Nxifiy it first, and then install it via its Nix expression (<code>foo.nix</code>). In this respect it shares the same pain point with <a href="http://www.gobolinux.org/">GoboLinux</a>. Personally this is not a huge problem for me, but it’s still a problem.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I hope this post gave you some motivation to try out NixOS. It has a steep learning curve but after you get most things working, it’s really great. Happy hacking!</p>

    <title>Emacs: Setting Up mmm-mode for Literate Haskell</title>

<p>I use <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Literate_programming">Literate Haskell</a> for some of my personal Haskell projects and for a long time I used the auto-loaded <code>literate-haskell-mode</code> that comes with <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-mode">haskell-mode</a>. This past weekend, I finally buckled down and made use of <a href="https://github.com/purcell/mmm-mode">mmm-mode</a> to make the literate programming experience better. The biggest advantage of using <code>mmm-mode</code> is that you can define subregions of your file which are handled by a different major mode. In other words, you can get proper syntax highlighting for 2, 3, or more different languages in the same file!</p>
<h1>Setup</h1>
<p>You’ll need to install <a href="https://github.com/purcell/mmm-mode">mmm-mode</a> along with <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-mode">haskell-mode</a>. I personally use <a href="http://melpa.org/">MELPA</a> for all of my Emacs packages because once you set it up it’s really painless.</p>
<p>In your <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html">emacs configuration file</a> add these lines:</p>
<pre><code>; Remove the hard-coded &#39;literate-haskell-mode&#39; activation for `.lhs&#39; files that
; haskell-mode comes with. In exchange, enable LaTeX mode whenever we open up a
; `.lhs&#39; file. Using mmm-mode, we will activate `haskell-mode&#39; in the code
; sections.
(setq auto-mode-alist
  (remove
    (rassoc &#39;literate-haskell-mode auto-mode-alist) auto-mode-alist))
(add-to-list &#39;auto-mode-alist &#39;(&quot;\\.lhs$&quot; . latex-mode))

; Literate Haskell - mmm-mode. Adopted from
; https://wiki.haskell.org/Literate_programming#Multi-mode_support_in_Emacs
(require &#39;mmm-auto)

(mmm-add-classes
  &#39;((literate-haskell-latex
    :submode haskell-mode
    :front &quot;^\\\\begin{code}\n&quot;
    :back &quot;^\\\\end{code}&quot;
  )))

; Re-fontify sub-mode portions when idle. The manual command for this is
; `mmm-parse-buffer&#39;. If you don&#39;t do this, then syntax highlighting won&#39;t work
; for new regions of Haskell code in the \begin{code}...\end{code} blocks.
(setq mmm-parse-when-idle &#39;t)
</code></pre>
<p>. Now it’s a matter of running the following commands whenever you open up a <code>.lhs</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>(setq mmm-global-mode &#39;t)
(setq mmm-submode-decoration-level 1)
(mmm-ify-by-class &#39;literate-haskell-latex)
</code></pre>
<p>. Personally I use <a href="https://github.com/listx/kakapo-mode">kakapo-mode</a> so I have a file called <code>kakapo-project-settings</code> that has this snippet in it:</p>
<pre><code>(defun my-kakapo-indents ()

  ...

  ; Literate Haskell
  ((string-match &quot;\\.lhs$&quot; b)
    (progn
      (h &#39;latex-mode-hook t 4)
      (setq mmm-global-mode &#39;t)
      (setq mmm-submode-decoration-level 1)
      (mmm-ify-by-class &#39;literate-haskell-latex)
    )
  )

  ...

)
</code></pre>
<p>. Emacs will now automatically pick up <code>.lhs</code> files and apply <code>latex-mode</code> and <code>haskell-mode</code> with <code>mmm-mode</code>. Happy hacking!</p>

	<br>
	<a href="/tag/programming.html">programming</a>, <a href="/tag/linux.html">linux</a>
</div>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>I’ve been using <a href="http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html">rxvt-unicode</a> (<code>urxvt</code>) for years. But, I never really bothered to customize it beyond adding in some simple font changing hotkeys. I discovered that <code>urxvt</code> can be customized with Perl plugins. This post shows some of the plugins I’ve started using.</p>
<p>For this post, I will use the terms <strong>terminal</strong> and <code>urxvt</code> interchangeably. The plugins are configured in your <code>~/.Xdefaults</code> file, and to have this file take effect, run</p>
<pre><code>xrdb -merge ~/.Xdefaults
</code></pre>
<p>. The hotkeys are defined with key names from <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/proto/x11proto/plain/keysymdef.h">keysymdef.h</a> as part of X11.</p>
<h1>keyboard-select</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/muennich/urxvt-perls">Homepage</a> (part of <code>urxvt-perls</code>)</p>
<p>This is by far the most useful plugin. If you ever need surgical precision to select a particular chunk of text in your terminal, you can use this plugin. It gives you Vim-like <em>normal mode</em> navigation in your terminal — and then you can use hotkeys like <code>v</code> or <code>V</code> to select chunks of text, and use <code>y</code> to copy it to your X primary buffer.</p>
<p>I use the snippet below in my <code>~/.Xdefaults</code>:</p>
<pre><code>! keyboard-select
URxvt.keysym.M-s: perl:keyboard-select:activate
URxvt.keysym.M-r: perl:keyboard-select:search
</code></pre>
<p>. Now, <code>M-s</code> (<code>Alt-s</code> for you folks not familiar with Emacs-style shortcut-naming) in the terminal gives you Vim-like normal mode like I mentioned above. The other shortcut, <code>M-r</code>, gives your reverse search against your terminal’s buffer.</p>
<p>Let <code>M-r</code> sink in. This means that your terminal is basically running a virtual <code>less</code> pager. Any time you want to go search against some text in your terminal, just use <code>M-r</code> and search; use <code>n</code> and <code>N</code> just like <code>less</code>.</p>
<p>Actually, <code>M-r</code> is basically doing <code>M-s</code> followed by <code>?</code>. So, if you like searching forwards (not backwards), just do <code>M-s</code> and then <code>/</code>. But considering how terminal buffers are always <strong>above</strong> the cursor, it makes sense to search backwards by default with <code>M-r</code>. For me this runs against my habit of using <code>less</code> and <code>/</code>, but there you have it.</p>
<h1>clipboard</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/muennich/urxvt-perls">Homepage</a> (part of <code>urxvt-perls</code>)</p>
<p><code>~/.Xdefaults</code> snippet:</p>
<pre><code>! clipboard
! update clipboard whenever primary gets updated
URxvt.clipboard.autocopy: true
URxvt.keysym.M-c: perl:clipboard:copy
URxvt.keysym.M-v: perl:clipboard:paste
URxvt.keysym.M-C-v: perl:clipboard:paste_escaped
</code></pre>
<p>. To be honest I think the <code>autocopy</code> feature is a bit flaky (at least when using these shortcuts inside a NixOS VirtualBox VM from a Mac) — but that’s not that important.</p>
<p><code>M-c</code> copies the X11 primary buffer (aka X selection) to the clipboard buffer.</p>
<p>What’s really nice is the <code>M-v</code> shortcut — it pastes the <strong>clipboard</strong> buffer, not the X11 primary buffer (there is <code>S-&lt;insert&gt;</code> (Shift-Insert) for that). Now you don’t have to type <code>$(xsel -b)</code> for the same thing.</p>
<p><code>M-C-v</code> (<code>Alt-Control-v</code>) does the same thing, but escapes any special characters. This is very handy — a simple use case might be using <code>M-s</code> (search shortcut discussed above) to find a particular file with a long name (think MP3 files) from the output of <code>ls</code> — you can then just use <code>v</code> to copy that filename to the X11 buffer, then use <code>M-c</code> to copy it to clipboard buffer (if <code>autocopy</code> is working this step is unnecessary), then use <code>M-C-v</code> to paste it in, escaping things like space characters so that you can use other tools like <code>cp</code> or <code>mv</code> on them more easily.</p>
<h1>url-select</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/muennich/urxvt-perls">Homepage</a> (part of <code>urxvt-perls</code>)</p>
<p><code>~/.Xdefaults</code> snippet:</p>
<pre><code>! url-select. We can middle-click on any url and this will launch the browser
! defined by `URxvt.url-select.launcher`.
URxvt.keysym.M-u: perl:url-select:select_next
URxvt.url-select.underline: true
URxvt.url-select.launcher: firefox
</code></pre>
<p>. Now you can use <code>M-u</code> to jump between any URL that was printed to the terminal buffer. Use <code>j</code> and <code>k</code> to jump to the next/previous URL, and <code>y</code> to copy it to your X primary buffer (and <code>M-c</code> to make sure it’s also in the clipboard) for easy URL handling. Or, simply press <code>ENTER</code> to open that link in your browser. Next time you grab your mouse to carefully highlight a URL in the terminal, think again!</p>
<h1>font-size</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/majutsushi/urxvt-font-size">Homepage</a></p>
<p>This plugin allows you to scale fonts up or down.</p>
<p><code>~/.Xdefaults</code> snippet:</p>
<pre><code>! `font-size` plugin
URxvt.keysym.C-minus: perl:font-size:decrease
URxvt.keysym.C-equal: perl:font-size:increase
! The default font increase step size is 1. This is for portability across all
! fonts (some fonts do not support particular font sizes). Because changing font
! size only really makes sense for anti-aliased fonts (Terminus is bitmapped),
! and because anti-aliased fonts support any size, it makes sense to just use a
! size step of 4 for faster transitions between font size changes.

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The heart of this problem comes from TopCoder’s <a href="http://community.topcoder.com/stat?c%3Dproblem_statement&amp;pm%3D11146&amp;rd%3D14238">SRM 485 “AfraidOfEven”</a>. There is quite a lot of discussion behind the somewhat elementary math principles, so you might want to skip down to the code directly after reading the problem statement.</p>
<h1>The Problem</h1>
<p>An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression">arithmetic progression</a> <span class="math inline">\(AP\)</span> has been changed by the mutation function <span class="math inline">\(M()\)</span> in the following way: any even number <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> in the sequence has been replaced by <span class="math inline">\(\frac{w}{2}\)</span>, repeatedly, until it has become odd. For example, if <span class="math inline">\(AP = \{2, 4, 6, 8\}\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(M(AP) = \{1, 1, 3, 1\}\)</span> (because <span class="math inline">\(\frac{6}{2} = 3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> is an odd number, it stopped mutating). Given a mutated sequence <span class="math inline">\(M(AP) = MP\)</span>, design an “unmutate” function <span class="math inline">\(U()\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(U(MP) \approx AP\)</span>. If more than one possible sequence <span class="math inline">\(AP\)</span> exists, find the one with the lowest lexicographical order.</p>
<h2>Constraints</h2>
<p><span class="math inline">\(MP\)</span> is limited to 4 to 50 terms. Each term in <span class="math inline">\(MP\)</span> is from <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(1000\)</span>, inclusive (for now; later on we will consider numbers less than <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>). The difference (let’s call it <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>) between each term can be <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, so the following is still a valid arithmetic progression: <span class="math inline">\(\{-17, -17, -17, -17, -17\}\)</span>.</p>
<h3>Lexicographic Order</h3>
<p>Given the input</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
MP = \{1, 1, 3, 1, 5\}
\]</span></p>
<p>, we get the output</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
U(AP) = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}
\]</span></p>
<p>. It is possible that <span class="math inline">\(AP\)</span> was actually <span class="math inline">\(\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\}\)</span> (or even <span class="math inline">\(\{4, 8, 12, 16, 20\}\)</span>), but because <span class="math inline">\(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\)</span> has the smaller lexicographic representation, it is the correct answer.</p>
<h1>Interlude</h1>
<p>I will include both Haskell and Ruby solutions in this post below. If you’d like to solve the problem on your own, please read the rest of this post at a later time.</p>
<h1>The Math</h1>
<p>Let us consider the universe of possible arithmetic progressions, and then derive a general algorithm. Because the mutation involves even numbers, it makes sense to look at arithmetic progressions in terms of even and odd numbers (aka <em>parity</em>).</p>
<p>The two most important parts of an arithmetic progression are the rate of change, <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, and the first term <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span>. This is because any arithmetic progression can be recreated by knowing only these two values.</p>
<p>Now, <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> can be either even (<span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>), odd (<span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>), or zero. The first term <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span> can be either even or odd. Let’s plug these possible variations into a table, and see if there are any patterns we can exploit. To determine <span class="math inline">\(AP\)</span> based on <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span>, we only need to know three laws of parity:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{O + O = E}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{E + E = E}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{O + E = O}\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>. Using these laws, we can construct the entire sequence <span class="math inline">\(AP\)</span> by adding <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> into <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span> repeatedly.</p>
<p>The only time that adding two numbers together results in an odd number is when one term is odd and the other term is even. This rule is true regardless of whether we are adding or subtracting (adding a negative term), or whether either term is positive or negative. Another interesting point is that adding by an even number does not change the parity of the original term, while adding by an odd number always flips the parity of the original. We now know how to construct <span class="math inline">\(AP\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span>, so let’s examine the possible outcomes below:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">

<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(\{\mathrm{E, O, E, O, \cdots{}}\}\)</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>. Let’s now look at each of the 6 possible cases, and see if we can simplify things more. We will look at each case from the perspective of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>.</p>
<h2>Mutation When <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is Zero</h2>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is zero, then <span class="math display">\[AP = {A_0, A_0, A_0\cdots{}A_0}\]</span>. That is, subsequent terms after <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span> do not change, so it is a constant sequence of the first term, <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is zero and <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span> is <strong>odd</strong>, then all terms remain the same after the mutation; so, <span class="math inline">\(M(AP) = AP\)</span> (no change). E.g.,</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(AP = \{\mathrm{3, 3, 3, 3, \cdots{}, 3}\}\)</span></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="center">becomes</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(MP = \{\mathrm{3, 3, 3, 3, \cdots{}, 3}\}\)</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>. If <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is zero and <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span> is <strong>even</strong>, then all terms are likewise even, and all terms will become odd by application of <span class="math inline">\(M()\)</span>. What’s more, every term in <span class="math inline">\(M_0\)</span> will be the same odd number, essentially becoming “reduced” to the case where <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span> was originally odd. E.g.,</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(AP = \{\mathrm{10, 10, 10, 10, \cdots{}, 10}\}\)</span></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="center">becomes</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(MP = \{\mathrm{5, 5, 5, 5, \cdots{}, 5}\}\)</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>.</p>
<h2>Mutation When <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is Even</h2>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is even, then all terms in <span class="math inline">\(AP\)</span> are either even or odd, based on the first term <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span>. Essentially, <span class="math inline">\(AP\)</span> behaves in an identical manner to the case where <span class="math inline">\(m = 0\)</span> as far as parity is concerned — the only difference here is that the subsequent terms change in value by <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>.</p>
<p>However, there is a slight twist when we apply mutation. If <span class="math inline">\(A_0 = \mathrm{O}\)</span>, then there are no numbers to mutate, and we get <span class="math inline">\(MP\)</span> where all terms are odd and they change by <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. But if <span class="math inline">\(A_0 = \mathrm{E}\)</span>, then we get <em>changing</em> even numbers for <span class="math inline">\(MP\)</span>. So unlike in the case of <span class="math inline">\(m = 0\)</span> where all even numbers reduced down to the same odd number after applying the mutation, we get <em>different</em> odd numbers. E.g.,</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(AP = \{\mathrm{40, 48, 56, 64, 72}\}\)</span></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="center">becomes</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(MP = \{\mathrm{5, 3, 7, 1, 9}\}\)</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>. Notice how even though <span class="math inline">\(AP\)</span> has a sequence of <em>increasing</em> terms, <span class="math inline">\(MP\)</span>’s terms are not increasing in the same manner. We will revisit this case below when simplifying the categories of behavior for <span class="math inline">\(MP\)</span>.</p>
<h2>Mutation When <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is Odd</h2>
<p>This is where things get interesting. If <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is odd, then <span class="math inline">\(AP\)</span> becomes a <em>series of alternating even and odd numbers</em>. Whether <span class="math inline">\(AP\)</span> begins with an even or odd number depends, naturally, on the parity of <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span>. The more general observation we can make is that, given the fact that we have alternating even and odd numbers in <span class="math inline">\(AP\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(MP\)</span> will be populated with “originally odd” and “fake odd” (mutated) terms. Let’s call these mutated terms <span class="math inline">\(O_F\)</span>. So if <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is odd, then we get either</p>

<tr class="odd">
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(AP = \{\mathrm{O, E, O, E}\}, MP = \{\mathrm{O, O_F, O, O_F}\}\)</span></td>

<tr class="even">
<td align="center">or</td>

<h1>A Summary of the Behavior of the Mutation Function <span class="math inline">\(M()\)</span></h1>
<p>We’ve exhausted the universe of all possible arithmetic sequences, and how they would mutate after applying <span class="math inline">\(M()\)</span>. We know exactly how <span class="math inline">\(M()\)</span> behaves in all edge cases! Let us now simplify the various cases to two general cases.</p>
<h2>There is nothing to “unmutate” as <span class="math inline">\(MP\)</span> is already the same as the answer <span class="math inline">\(AP\)</span></h2>
<p>This can happen in two ways. The easiest way is if <span class="math inline">\(m = 0\)</span>, where all terms in <span class="math inline">\(MP\)</span> are the same and there is nothing to calculate (<span class="math inline">\(M()\)</span> will ensure that this case always results in the same repeating odd number). The other way is if <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is even, and <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span> is odd — resulting in an “unmutatable” sequence such that <span class="math inline">\(M(AP) = AP\)</span>. E.g. (where <span class="math inline">\(m = 10\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A_0 = 11\)</span>),</p>

<h2>The terms in <span class="math inline">\(AP\)</span> alternate between even and odd</h2>
<p>This covers the case when <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is odd. If <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is odd, then regardless of the parity of <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span>, we get an alternating sequence of even and odd numbers. The import thing to keep in mind here is that the even numbers will mutate after <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{M()}\)</span> is applied, while the odd numbers will stay as-is as “originals”.</p>
<h1>How to Design <span class="math inline">\(U()\)</span></h1>
<p>Let’s think back to what our mutation function <span class="math inline">\(M()\)</span> does: it simply mutates an even number to an odd number by repeatedly dividing it by 2. If the number if odd to begin with, then there is nothing to mutate; essentially, <em>original</em> odd numbers act as immutable beacons of truth — they do not have to change form when returning to their <span class="math inline">\(AP\)</span> form! Our task in designing an “unmutate” function <span class="math inline">\(U()\)</span> is to preserve the “honest” odd numbers while converting the mutated, “fake” odd numbers back to their evenness, to get back the original progression <span class="math inline">\(AP\)</span> (or at least something close to it if there are multiple such <span class="math inline">\(AP\)</span>s out there.</p>
<p>You can now see where our extensive parity breakdown of the possible <span class="math inline">\(MP\)</span> can come in handy — we know in what patterns the honest odd numbers show themselves in <em>any</em> <span class="math inline">\(MP\)</span>. Let’s rewrite the table of all possibilities, with this analogy of “honest” and “fake” (<span class="math inline">\(O_F\)</span>) odd numbers after the mutation.</p>

<p>As you can see, the two dominating patterns are either the all-odd (and honest!) numbers (first 3 rows) or the alternating honest or fake odd numbers. But what about the case where <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is a nonzero even value and <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span> is even as well (row 4)? In the universe of all possible even numbers of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span>, how can we know for a fact that the mutation to <span class="math inline">\(MP\)</span> will fall into a neat pattern?</p>
<h1>When both <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span> are even</h1>
<p>The short answer is, we can prove that all such sequences will mutate to the familiar <span class="math inline">\(\{\mathrm{O, O, O, O, \cdots{}}\}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\{\mathrm{O, O_F, O, O_F, \cdots{}}\}\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(\{\mathrm{O_F, O, O_F, O, \cdots{}}\}\)</span> pattern shown in the table above. The long answer is that it helps to think of linear equations, and to see the possible ways in which we can <em>grow</em> the <span class="math inline">\(AP\)</span> progression from <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span>.</p>
<p>If you paid attention in high school algebra class, you will probably remember the formula <span class="math inline">\(y = mx + b\)</span> to describe a straight line (except the vertical line!) in the cartesian coordinate system (in the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> axes). We can use the <strong>same</strong> equation to describe the growth behavior of an arithmetic sequence! And for that, we use the following translation:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(y = mx + b\)</span></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="center">becomes</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(A_n = mn + A_0\)</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>, where <span class="math inline">\(A_n\)</span> is the n-th term to be calculated in <span class="math inline">\(AP\)</span>. Luckily, we’ve used the same letter <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> in both contexts — it describes the rate of change in one, and the distance between each term in the other. Let’s simplify the equation with a concern to parity only.</p>
<p>First, let’s rewrite the equation as follows:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(A_n = \mathrm{E\cdot{}}n + \mathrm{E}\)</span></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="center">or</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(A_n = \mathrm{E_m}\cdot{}n + \mathrm{E_{A0}}\)</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>. The <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{E}\)</span> here represents that this number is an even number, with the subscript denoting whether it is <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{E_m}\)</span>) or the first term in the sequence (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{E_{A0}}\)</span>). If we use this equation to map out the first 4 elements of <span class="math inline">\(AP\)</span>, we get the following:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(A_0 = \mathrm{E_m\cdot{}0 + E_{A0}}\)</span></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(A_1 = \mathrm{E_m\cdot{}1 + E_{A0}}\)</span></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(A_2 = \mathrm{E_m\cdot{}2 + E_{A0}}\)</span></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(A_3 = \mathrm{E_m\cdot{}3 + E_{A0}}\)</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>. It should be noted that both <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{E_m}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{E_{A0}}\)</span> remain the <strong>same</strong> throughout the entire sequence <span class="math inline">\(AP\)</span>. The only thing that changes is <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, which always increments by <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, starting from <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.</p>
<p>And now we’re faced with a problem. Ideally, we’d like to get rid of all those even terms in our formula — they don’t help us out at all! This is where we use the concept of <em>scaling</em>. There are two scaling rules: (1) if you multiply all terms of an arithmetic progression by some nonzero integer <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, <em>the new progression remains arithmetic</em>; (2) the same is true if you divide all terms by <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<p>The first scaling rule works because</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(A_n = \mathrm{E_m\cdot{}}n + \mathrm{E_{A0}}\)</span></td>

<tr class="even">
<td align="center">becomes</td>

<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(A_n\cdot{}k = (\mathrm{E_m}\cdot{}{k})\cdot{}n + \mathrm{E_{A0}}\cdot{}k\)</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<p>, where the terms <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{E_{A0}}\cdot{}k\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{E_m}\cdot{}k\)</span> both remain as constants — we are still dealing with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial">degree 1 polynomial</a> (linear expression). Apart from increasing the first term <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{A_0}\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, all we did was increase the gap between each term by a factor of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. Likewise, if you <em>divide</em> all terms of an arithmetic progression by some nonzero integer <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, the new progression still remains arithmetic, because what you are doing is</p>

<p>. Division is simply multiplication by the inverse, so the same reasoning as for the first scaling rule applies here as well. By the way, we don’t have to worry about what <span class="math inline">\(A_n\cdot{}k\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\frac{A_n}{k}\)</span> would look like — we are merely concerned with how <em>parity</em> behaves, and for that we rely on the right hand side of the equation.</p>
<p>Going back to our problem, recall that we want to ultimately output some arithmetic progression that <em>could</em> have resulted in the given mutated list <span class="math inline">\(MP\)</span>. This is what scaling gives us — it gives us the leeway that we need to stay within our original problem domain while changing around the parity of <span class="math inline">\(A_n\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let us scale the entire progression by <span class="math inline">\(k = \frac{1}{2}\)</span>. That is, let us repeatedly divide <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{E_m}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{E_{A0}}\)</span> by 2, until one or both of them become odd. When either one becomes odd, we stop scaling and reuse the parity laws we discussed above to draw deeper conclusions. Which variable, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{E_m}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{E_{A0}}\)</span>, has more 2’s in it (as prime factors)? Which term is more <em>even</em> than the other?</p>
<p>There are three possible scenarios when we scale (let’s call it <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{S()}\)</span>) by <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> <strong>repeatedly</strong> as described above: (1) <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{E_{A0}}\)</span> becomes odd first, (2) <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{E_m}\)</span> becomes odd first, or (3) both become equally odd. If we write these three scenarios into a table, we get the following:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="center"></th>
<th align="center">Scaled by <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> repeatedly</th>

</table>
<p>. The parity of each scaled <span class="math inline">\(AP\)</span> is calculated by simply replacing <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> with 0, 1, 2, etc. and relying on our three parity laws from the beginning of this post. If you want to lessen your load of mental arithmetic, we can simplify the parity expressions further. If we reword the additive parity laws with multiplication in mind (which is simply addition repeated many times over), we can derive two more parity laws:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{E\cdot{}}n = \mathrm{E}\)</span>, regardless of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, and</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{O\cdot{}}n = \mathrm{P}_n\)</span> — i.e., the parity of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{O\cdot{}}n\)</span> is the same as the parity of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> itself</li>
</ol>
<p>. Going back to our table above, we can simplify the scaled expressions further:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{E + O} = \mathrm{O}\)</span>, because adding by an even number preserves the parity of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{O}\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{P}_n + \mathrm{E} = \mathrm{P}_n\)</span>, because adding by an even number preserves the parity of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{P}_n\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{P}_n + \mathrm{O} = \neg{}\mathrm{P}_n\)</span>, because adding by an odd number flips the parity of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{P}_n\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>.</p>
<p>And now we can finally say that when both <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span> are even, the parity of terms in in <span class="math inline">\(AP\)</span> can be either all odd or alternating between even and odd! I.e., if both <span class="math inline">\(m = \mathrm{E}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A_0 = \mathrm{E}\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(M(AP) = \{\mathrm{O, O, O, O, \cdots{}}\}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\{\mathrm{O, O_F, O, O_F, \cdots{}}\}\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(\{\mathrm{O_F, O, O_F, O, \cdots{}}\}\)</span>!</p>
<h1>Back to Designing <span class="math inline">\(U()\)</span></h1>
<p>Through our discussion up to this point, we’ve established that the universe of all possible <span class="math inline">\(MP\)</span>’s fall under three parity patterns: all honest odd (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{O}\)</span>) terms, or alternating between “honest” odd (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{O}\)</span>) and “fake” odd (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{O_F}\)</span>) terms. There are actually four patterns because the all-honest-odd-terms pattern can be broken down into two cases: (1) all terms are the same odd number (<span class="math inline">\(m = 0\)</span>), or (2) the terms are the same as those in <span class="math inline">\(AP\)</span> (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(AP\)</span> was all odd terms to begin with, so there was no actual mutation involved by applying <span class="math inline">\(M()\)</span>).</p>
<p>So, we can finally start sketching out the design for our “unmutate” function <span class="math inline">\(U()\)</span>.</p>

<p>The interesting point is in line 18; thanks to our math work, we can even declare that a given mutated sequence was somehow either tampered with, or that the original sequence was not an arithmetic progression! We can make these assertions because we’ve exhausted all possible cases of arithmetic sequences and their mutations — and if things don’t fit the way we expect them to, then the only conclusion is that the given sequence <span class="math inline">\(MP\)</span> was not a byproduct of mutating an <em>arithmetic sequence</em>, but some other kind of sequence. Behold the power of math!</p>
<p>The other thing is that in line 34 we allow <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> as a possible value in <span class="math inline">\(AP\)</span>. This means that after a mutation, we might still have an even number (<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>) in <span class="math inline">\(MP\)</span>! Although this sounds like it would break all of the mathematic discussion we’ve had so far, it does not — the proof is in the Haskell code below. The short answer is that a <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> is harmless because it shares the same quality — immutability — with all other originally odd terms in <span class="math inline">\(AP\)</span>; thus, treating it as an “odd” number does not change our logic.</p>

<p>This Ruby version is essentially a port of the Haskell version. The problem at hand is so mathematical that it makes sense to simply preserve the clean Haskell definitions.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I hope you enjoyed this somewhat prolonged mathematical adventure. The most interesting part for me was seeing the problem as a linear equation, and using the formula (which I learned in high school) to derive powerful conclusions. High school algebra is useful after all! Until next time, happy hacking!</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>I recently purchased an ErgoDox keyboard<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, and I’ve been thinking about creating my own keyboard layout in the spirit of the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard layout (DSK). One of the guiding principles of DSK was putting an emphasis on reducing finger travel by identifying the most commonly occurring letters of the English language, and placing them on the home row of the keyboard. Now, the Dvorak layout was patented in 1936 according to Wikipedia, with subsequent adjustments culminating in the present form of DSK.</p>
<p>I want to find out for myself what letters are the most common. Sure, I could blindly trust an online source like Wikipedia, but it just feels like an easy problem to solve. Also, I am not sure if Dvorak considered <em>word</em> frequency as well as <em>letter</em> frequency. Ideally, one should use the data of both word and letter frequency to determine what is the most commonly typed “letter” on a US ASCII keyboard for English writers.</p>
<h2 id="the-problems">The Problems</h2>
<h3 id="letter-frequency">Letter Frequency</h3>
<p>Write a program that reads a file (plaintext) and counts how many times each letter occurs in the file. You must treat <code>A</code> as the same letter as <code>a</code>. You may limit yourself to the plain US ASCII 26-letter alphabet, discarding all letters with diacritics. Sort the letters by their frequence; for each letter, display the letter itself, its relative frequency percentage to the file as a whole, and the number of times this letter appears (raw count). E.g., the letter <code>a</code> counted by this program might look like this: <code>a = 2.00% (200 occurrences)</code>.</p>
<h3 id="word-frequency">Word Frequency</h3>
<p>Write a program that reads a file (plaintext) and counts how many times each <em>word</em> occurs in the file. The precise definition of a “word” is up to you, but you must exclude arabic numerals and also standalone punctuation characters (e.g., “* is not a word”). Display the 100 most common words in similar fashion to the Letter Frequency problem.</p>
<p>Both the letter and word frequency problems will use the Project Gutenberg plaintext file of <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701.txt"><em>Moby Dick</em></a>.</p>
<p>Now, before you go on to read my solutions, I encourage you to write a solution on your own using your favorite programming language.</p>

<h3 id="letter-frequency-1">Letter Frequency</h3>
<p>The <code>freq_l</code> method views letters in the limited US ASCII range and uses crude, C-like letter-to-integer equivalence via <code>char_to_idx</code>. We use a simple array of 26 integers, each one corresponding to a letter. But thanks to its stupidity, <code>freq_l</code> runs quite fast — chugging through Moby Dick in a few seconds on my Core i7-4770K 4GHz machine.</p>
<h3 id="word-frequency-1">Word Frequency</h3>
<p>The <code>freq_w</code> method relies almost entirely on a single regex, <code>/\W*\s\W*/</code>, to split the input into words. These words are further processed; we perform a basic sanity check with the <code>/\w/</code> regex to make sure we are not dealing with just numbers or punctuation, and we also take into account the em dash <code>--</code>. We use a basic hash structure to store the words as keys, and their counts as values.</p>

<h3 id="letter-frequency-2">Letter Frequency</h3>
<p><code>freqL</code> handles letter frequency, and it is a simple <code>foldl</code> operation over the input, while using the <code>Map</code> data structure from the <code>Data.Map</code> library (which acts as a simple hash structure with keys and values). The de facto Haskell compiler GHC comes with the <code>base</code> library which includes the <code>Data.Char</code> module; unlike Ruby, we can simply ask whether a character is a letter with <code>isAlpha</code>, and then use <code>toLower</code> on it to convert it to lowercase. <code>freqL</code> owes its brevity to these standard library functions.</p>
<p>Thanks to these standard library functions, we can easily keep track of more than just the basic 26 alphabetical letters (although in the case of <em>Moby Dick</em>, there does not seem to be any such characters).</p>
<h3 id="word-frequency-2">Word Frequency</h3>
<p>This is probably a convoluted way to keep track of words. I did not opt for using regular expressions, because I wanted to try out a different approach instead of just translating the Ruby solution. I could have used the excellent Parsec library, but I just felt like rolling my own solution.</p>
<p><code>freqW</code> works by looking at just one character at a time, just like <code>freqL</code>. It also keeps track of the evaluation of the previously-looked-at character, with the <code>wfsm</code> variable (for <em>Word Finite State Machine</em>, a fancy but still pertinent name). <code>wfsm</code> can either say that the last character made us go <em>in</em> a word (<code>WordIn</code>), <em>out</em> of a word for sure (<code>WordOut</code>), or possibly out of a word (<code>WordOutMaybe</code>). Depending on the status of <code>wfsm</code> and the current character, <code>freqW</code> makes various choices.</p>
<p>Now, this mechanism isn’t without its warts. But still, I consider it somewhat elegant in its description of all possible states.</p>
<h2 id="a-diff">A Diff</h2>
<p>For fun, let’s look at the diff of the outputs of the Ruby and Haskell versions. Interestingly, the letter frequency outputs were identical. The word frequency outputs did have some significant changes, such as the word <em>whale</em> occurring 972 and 1108 times in the Ruby and Haskell versions, respectively. I’ve sorted the output by lines for saner diffing.</p>

<p>. The most common French word in this book is <em>de</em>, meaning <em>of</em> in English. This is because the word for <em>the</em> is split into many different words, most notably <em>la</em> and <em>le</em>, not to mention <em>l’</em> as in <em>l’homme</em> (as you can see near the end of the list), due to the French language’s gender and vowel contraction rules (unlike English, contractions like <em>l’homme</em> in French are mandatory regardless of tone).</p>
<p>And, as a bit of trivia, it is interesting to note that <em>dieu</em> (God) edges out <em>l’homme</em> (man) by 7 occurrences in this text.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope you’ve had some fun working on these letter and word frequency problems. The word frequency problem, if you really want to do it correctly, should be handled by a parser using a robust library. By writing these programs, I learned that the <em>input</em> of a program (Unicode? ASCII only?) is just as important as its output.</p>
<p>Happy hacking!</p>

</div>

<p>In an earlier post, I discussed <a href="2013-07-12-generating-random-numbers-without-modulo-bias.html">how to remove modulo bias from your C code</a>. I would like to add a different version of removing modulo bias, inspired by the code from the <a href="http://www.pcg-random.org/">PCG family</a> of random number generators.</p>
<h2 id="the-pcg-version">The PCG Version</h2>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.pcg-random.org/download.html">official minimal C implementation</a> of PCG, there is a function called <code>pcg32_boundedrand_r</code>, which takes a <code>bound</code> variable. The code for that function is as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><table class="sourceCode numberLines c"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="dt">uint32_t</span> pcg32_boundedrand_r(pcg32_random_t* rng, <span class="dt">uint32_t</span> bound)
{
	<span class="dt">uint32_t</span> threshold = -bound % bound;
	<span class="kw">for</span> (;;) {
		<span class="dt">uint32_t</span> r = pcg32_random_r(rng);
		<span class="kw">if</span> (r &gt;= threshold)
			<span class="kw">return</span> r % bound;
	}
}</code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<p>. If <code>bound</code> is 5, then the function will return a uniform range from 0 to 4. I.e., the return value <code>r</code> is such that <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq r &lt; bound\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="explanation-of-the-pcg-version">Explanation of the PCG Version</h2>
<p>Although I generally prefer to explain code in the order they appear, top to bottom, for this case I would like to explain the <code>pcg32_boundedrand_r()</code> function by talking about the usual broken version found in the wild.</p>
<h3 id="broken-version">Broken Version</h3>
<p>The broken version is like this:</p>
<pre><code>r = some_rng();
return r % bound;</code></pre>
<p>. Unless <code>r</code> is a multiple of <code>bound</code>, we will incur the wrath of modulo bias in the above code. Why is this? Well, consider what the modulo operator does. All it does is chop off any excess range of values that is not a multiple of <code>bound</code>. Consider the following ASCII diagram, where the maximum value returned by our <code>some_rng()</code> function is just 11:</p>
<pre><code>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11</code></pre>
<p>. So, <code>some_rng()</code> has 12 possible unique values, 0 through 11. If our bound was <code>4</code>, then doing <code>r % bound</code> is perfectly fine, because we can chop the RNG range into three equal parts of length 4 each, like this:</p>
<pre><code>0 1 2 3 | 4 5 6 7 | 8 9 10 11</code></pre>
<p>. If each of the 12 values 0 through 11 occurs uniformly<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, then we can assume that each of the values occurs <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{12}\)</span> times. If we apply <code>% 4</code> to the values, then our output range looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>0 1 2 3 | 0 1 2 3 | 0 1 2 3</code></pre>
<p>. Can you see how the three subparts are the same? What’s more, 0 will occur <span class="math inline">\(\frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}\)</span> times. The same goes for <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>. Because all 4 possible values, 0 through 4, occur an equal <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{4}\)</span> times, there is <em>no modulo bias here</em>!</p>
<h4 id="what-if-the-modulus-is-not-a-nice-number-with-respect-to-rand_max">What if the modulus is not a nice number with respect to <code>RAND_MAX</code>?</h4>
<p>This is where the problem occurs. <code>RAND_MAX</code> is the highest value returned by our RNG, and thus defines the range of the possible values output by the RNG.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Continuing with our example above, if instead of <code>bound = 4</code>, we used another value like 5, we will get this instead:</p>
<pre><code>0 1 2 3 4 | 5 6 7 8 9 | 10 11</code></pre>
<p>— or essentially, these values are output if we just naively use <code>r % bound</code>:</p>
<pre><code>0 1 2 3 4 | 0 1 2 3 4 | 0 1</code></pre>
<p>. Can you see how <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> will occur <span class="math inline">\(\frac{3}{12}\)</span> times, but <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, and <code>4</code> will occur only <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{12}\)</span> times?</p>
<h4 id="the-fix-adjust-the-range">The fix — adjust the range!</h4>
<p>Now, we can fix the above example by simply throwing out certain values. The approach I used in the <a href="2013-07-12-generating-random-numbers-without-modulo-bias.html">old blog post</a> was to discard the right hand side values. So, in our example with <code>bound = 5</code>, where we have</p>
<pre><code>0 1 2 3 4 | 0 1 2 3 4 | 0 1</code></pre>
<p>, the old example tried to discard the last 2 values, like this:</p>
<pre><code>0 1 2 3 4 | 0 1 2 3 4 | x x</code></pre>
<p>. In other words, if <code>r</code> fell within the range 10 through 11, then we’d simply discard it and call <code>some_rand()</code> again.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t have to be this way. Instead of throwing out the values on the right, we can throw out the values on the left! So, instead of</p>
<pre><code>0 1 2 3 4 | 0 1 2 3 4 | x x</code></pre>
<p>we can instead do</p>
<pre><code>x x 2 3 4 | 0 1 2 3 4 | 0 1</code></pre>
<p>. Can you see how all of the values 0 through 4 occur exactly 2 times? No more bias!</p>
<h3 id="pcgs-approach">PCG’s approach</h3>
<p>The approach in PCG is the same; here is the code again:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><table class="sourceCode numberLines c"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="dt">uint32_t</span> pcg32_boundedrand_r(pcg32_random_t* rng, <span class="dt">uint32_t</span> bound)
{
	<span class="dt">uint32_t</span> threshold = -bound % bound;
	<span class="kw">for</span> (;;) {
		<span class="dt">uint32_t</span> r = pcg32_random_r(rng);
		<span class="kw">if</span> (r &gt;= threshold)
			<span class="kw">return</span> r % bound;
	}
}</code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<p>. The <code>threshold</code> value is the initial range that must be discarded. So we can visualize it like this:</p>
<pre><code>x x 2 3 4 | 0 1 2 3 4 | 0 1

// The `x x` here is the initial threshold range, that must be discarded.</code></pre>
<p>On line 3, we determine the value of <code>threshold</code>, and then on line 4 we enter a <code>for</code> loop that repeatedly calls the RNG until we get a value outside of this threshold range (well, technically, <em>greater-than-or-equal-to</em> the threshold value). If we do get such a value, then we return the modulo of it. If we visualize it, it’s like this:</p>
<pre><code>0 1 2 3 4 | 5 6 7 8 9 | 10 11

- Discard 0 and 1 (the threshold area).

x x 2 3 4 | 5 6 7 8 9 | 10 11

- Return (r % bound).

x x 2 3 4 | 0 1 2 3 4 | 0 1</code></pre>
<p>.</p>
<h4 id="how-is-threshold-calculated">How is <code>threshold</code> calculated?</h4>
<p>The above high-level explanation should be sufficient for you, dear reader. But if you want to go down to the innards of C, to see how <code>pcg32_boundedrand_r</code> works, read on.</p>
<p>The cornerstone of the PCG approach is to use a variable called <code>threshold</code>. The code to calculate <code>threshold</code> is somewhat complicated:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="dt">uint32_t</span> threshold = -bound % bound;</code></pre></div>
<p>. Now, let’s remind ourselves that the whole point of <code>threshold</code> is to be a minimum value that sets a cutoff of values to be discarded — if the generated value <code>r</code> is too low (lower than our threshold), then we discard it.</p>
<p>Consider the following diagram, with <code>RAND_MAX</code> set to <code>11</code>, and <code>bound</code> set to 5:</p>
<pre><code>0 1 2 3 4 | 5 6 7 8 9 | 10 11</code></pre>
<p>. We can visualze the above like this instead:</p>
<pre><code>R R R R R | _ _ R R R | R R</code></pre>
<p>. The underscores represent the values that must be <em>skipped</em> over, in order to eliminate modulo bias. The question then, is to figure out how to count the number of underscores. In our case, it is 2, and so as long as we skip the first two values 0 and 1, we should be fine.</p>
<p>The first step is to count backwards from the right-hand edge:</p>
<pre><code>                |&lt;---count|
R R R R R | _ _ R R R | R R
                t         |
                          \-&gt; RAND_MAX</code></pre>
<p>. We end up where <code>t</code> is on the diagram above, by counting backwards from <code>RAND_MAX</code>. If we then take the modulo of this by <code>count</code> itself, then we end up with <code>t</code> being the value we want — the number of underscores. This is the essence of <code>-bound % bound</code> — we first take <code>-bound</code> which is obtained by counting backwards from <code>RAND_MAX</code>, and then we take the modulo of this number by <code>bound</code> itself, to get what we need. Using the ASCII diagram again, we get</p>
<pre><code>                |&lt;-----count|
0 1 2 3 4 | 5 6 7 8 9 | 10 11
                t          |
                           \-&gt; RAND_MAX
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>t</code> is 7, and now applying % 5, we get:</p>
<pre><code>0 1 2 3 4 | 0 1 2 3 4 | 0 1
                t</code></pre>
<p><code>t = 2</code>, the correct answer! You can try out different values for <code>RAND_MAX</code> and <code>bound</code>, but you will get the right answer each time using <code>threshold = -bound % bound</code>.</p>
<h5 id="but-why-is--bound-the-way-it-is">But why is <code>-bound</code> the way it is?</h5>
<p>The <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2711522/what-happens-if-i-assign-a-negative-value-to-an-unsigned-variable">C standard</a> says that a negative unsigned value is stored as a positive value. Without getting too technical, here are the values of <code>bound</code> as it becomes “negative”:</p>
<pre><code>Bound | Actual value
------+-------------
2     | 2
1     | 1
0     | 0
-1    | (2^32) - 1 (same as RAND_MAX)
-2    | (2^32) - 2 (same as RAND_MAX - 1)
-3    | (2^32) - 3 (same as RAND_MAX - 2)
... and so on</code></pre>
<p>. In our case, if our <code>RAND_MAX</code> is 11, and <code>bound</code> is 5, then <code>-bound</code> is indeed 7.</p>
<pre><code>Bound | Actual value
------+-------------
0     | 0
-1    | 11 - 0 (same as RAND_MAX)
-2    | 11 - 1 (same as RAND_MAX - 1)
-3    | 11 - 2 (same as RAND_MAX - 2)
-4    | 11 - 3 (same as RAND_MAX - 3)
-5    | 11 - 4 (same as RAND_MAX - 4) = 7
... and so on</code></pre>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed looking at the source code in PCG, only to discover an elegant solution around removing modulo bias. Unfortunately, I do not know the true origin of this approach; it is possible that the authors of the PCG code invented it, but I find this improbable. Meanwhile, I strongly recommend the following code for anyone using a low-level generator that does not come with a bounded version:</p>

<p>So just yesterday, I did a live coding interview. Looking back, the problem I was presented with was very simple, but true to my usual nervous self, I over-analzyed the problem — completely missing the point and needlessly complicating things. In an effort to redeem myself, I thought about the problem again and even went out as to write tests for it, in both Ruby and Haskell. If you want to have a crack at the problem yourself, be conservative about scrolling down the page! Without further ado, I present the problem to you.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>You are a game engine API writer. You need to implement a mechanism that allows your developers to store and retrieve game moves based on the input to the game engine. The two functions for this mechanism should be named <code>register()</code> and <code>on_button()</code>.</p>
<p><code>register()</code> should take a named button sequence, and store it into the database of all named sequences. A single named sequence might look like this: <code>([&quot;down&quot;, &quot;forward&quot;, &quot;punch&quot;], &quot;hadoken&quot;)</code>.</p>
<p><code>on_button()</code> should take a single key, and then return all named sequences that match the ones in the database. E.g., <code>on_button(&quot;punch&quot;)</code> should return <code>&quot;hadoken&quot;</code> if the previous two inputs were <code>&quot;down&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;forward&quot;</code>.</p>
<h3 id="some-constraints">Some Constraints</h3>
<h4 id="multiple-sequences">Multiple Sequences</h4>
<p>Because our API is flexible, we allow <em>multiple</em> named sequences with the <em>same sequence</em>. Thus, you can expect something like this:</p>
<pre><code>register([&quot;up&quot;, &quot;punch&quot;], &quot;uppercut&quot;)
register([&quot;up&quot;, &quot;punch&quot;], &quot;uppercut_2&quot;)
on_button(&quot;up&quot;)        # no result
on_button(&quot;punch&quot;)     # [&quot;uppercut&quot;, &quot;uppercut_2&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>. You don’t have to worry about multiple named sequences with the same sequence and also the same name — we will worry about this “exact duplicate” situation in a later version of our API.</p>
<h4 id="input-history">Input History</h4>
<p>You might have noticed that <code>on_button()</code> depends on the input history of whatever buttons were <em>previously</em> entered into the game. Because of this, you can alternatively write an <code>on_buttons()</code> function (plural with an “s”) that takes the history of buttons as input; this way you don’t have to silently depend on the global state of input history.</p>
<h2 id="my-nervous-wreck-solution">My Nervous-Wreck Solution</h2>
<p>I decided to use pure Haskell code in the actual interview. The code I wrote had the general idea, but it was a big failure because it performed a naive, custom search without any thought given to data structures. I actually went back and revised the code to make it compile and work <em>after</em> the interview was over; here it is in all its glory:</p>

<p>. I have to admit, the <code>step</code> function in <code>onButtons</code> is essentially unreadable. But it does work:</p>
<pre><code>$ ghci code/toy/game-button-seq/interview_ver.hs
GHCi, version 7.8.4: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help

[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( code/toy/game-button-seq/interview_ver.hs, interpreted )
Ok, modules loaded: Main.
*Main&gt; onButtons [&quot;down&quot;, &quot;down&quot;, &quot;forward&quot;, &quot;punch&quot;] buttonSeqDB
[&quot;charger&quot;,&quot;hadoken&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>.</p>
<p>Anyway, I will explain the behavior of the code. The first thing to notice is that we feed into <code>step</code> the <em>reversed</em> list of <code>buttonHist</code>, so that we examine the button press history, from newest to oldest. So we look at the just-pressed-button, then the one before that, and the one before, etc, backwards up the history.</p>
<p>As we look at each <code>button</code>, we use it to filter out all known sequences. This filtering is done in <code>remaining</code>, where we check the last button of every known sequence, and see if that matches the current button. That’s what the line <code>filter ((==button) . last . fst)</code> does; the sister line <code>filter (not . null . fst) dbRem</code> is just there to prevent calling <code>last</code> on an empty list.</p>
<p>After we’re done checking, we modify the entire sequence database <code>db</code>, such that we only care about the first <span class="math inline">\(N - 1\)</span> buttons in the sequence. This way, on the next iteration, we can rest assured that checking against the “last” button in a sequence is not always the same button. In subsequent runs of <code>step</code>, we have <code>dbRem</code>‘s sequences slowly get reduced down to nothing as we keep chopping off all sequences’ last button. Keep in mind that we feed the filtered, matching entries of <code>db</code> back into subsequent runs of <code>step</code>, so that effectively we’re only working with matching sequences. Once we reach down to no buttons, we label these named sequences as <code>entriesComplete</code>, and append it into <code>foundSoFar</code>.</p>
<h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3>
<p>Obviously, this code has many problems. First, it is virtually unreadable. Readability is important, and the code feels very counter-intuitive — it is marvelously complex when the problem statement sounds so simple.</p>
<p>Second, the fact that we have to bring in and mutate <code>dbRem</code>, which is a copy of the original given <code>ButtonSeqDB</code> type, seems wasteful. We’re wasting a lot of CPU cycles here.</p>
<h2 id="ruby-solution-using-hashes">Ruby Solution Using Hashes</h2>
<p>So on the day after (that is, <em>today</em> as of the time of this writing), I thought about the problem again and realized we can use hashes. It is a very simple approach, with far less lines of code. I even wrote some tests for it. Here is the implementation below.</p>

<h3 id="analysis-1">Analysis</h3>
<p>The key insight was when I realized that you could indeed use a hash even though we have the requirement that multiple, identical button sequences can have different names. The trick is to simply store the value as not a single name, but an array of possible names. This is reflected in the <code>GameButtonSeq.register</code> method.</p>
<p>The heart of <code>on_buttons()</code> is a single <code>while</code> loop that checks the given button history against the database; we reduce the button sequence by 1 button on each iteration to check against shorter matches as well. That’s what the <code>button_seq.shift</code> is for.</p>
<h2 id="haskell-solution-using-hashes">Haskell Solution Using Hashes</h2>
<p>Inspired by the Ruby solution, I rewrote a Haskell version — with tests to boot! Here is the implementation.</p>

<h3 id="analysis-2">Analysis</h3>
<p>This Haskell version uses the standard <code>Data.Map</code> module, which provides an efficient, basic hash data structure. What we first do is expand <code>buttonHist</code> to all of the cases we are interested in — namely, all of the subsequences of concern. E.g., given a list like <code>[&quot;up&quot;, &quot;down&quot;, &quot;right&quot;, &quot;left&quot;]</code>, <code>buttonHists</code> becomes:</p>
<pre><code>[ [&quot;up&quot;, &quot;down&quot;, &quot;right&quot;, &quot;left&quot;]
,       [&quot;down&quot;, &quot;right&quot;, &quot;left&quot;]
,               [&quot;right&quot;, &quot;left&quot;]
,                        [&quot;left&quot;]
]</code></pre>
<p>(spaces added for readability). What we do is reduce the initial input list into all of the “sublist” combinations of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> buttons, <span class="math inline">\(N - 1\)</span> buttons, <span class="math inline">\(N - 2\)</span> buttons, etc.</p>
<p>The next step is to simply look at each sublist with <code>concatMap</code>, calling <code>extractNames</code>; we treat each sublist as a key, and look for it in our <code>db</code> hash. We then simply concatenate the results.</p>
<p>The <code>onButtons2</code> is an alternate version which uses <code>mapMaybe</code> to reduce it down to just two lines of code.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I cringe as I look back at the half-baked code I wrote during the interview. Even the working, compilable version that I wrote after the interview remains ugly and hard to reason about. I can picture my interviewer being grossed out by my ugly, hacky version wondering if I even know what hashes are…</p>
<p>The moral of the story is to think carefully about the most obvious data structure to use, before embarking on writing a solution — no matter how trivial it seems. For myself, I was nervous and did not realize how simple the problem actually was until the day after when I rewrote the solution in Ruby. It was so simple and straightforward that I even wrote some test cases for it<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>I hope you had some fun writing out your own solutions. Happy hacking!</p>

<p>I recently installed and configured NixOS on a laptop and had to learn how to develop Haskell on it. The Nix community uses something called <code>cabal2nix</code> (version 2.0 and up!) and <code>nix-shell</code> to get the job done. While things work quite smoothly right now in NixOS, I was wondering if I could do the same on my desktop Arch Linux box.</p>
<p>The answer is yes — you can easily use Nix to create a ‘system sandbox’ of sorts (the Nix store) that is completely isolated from Arch’s own Haskell packages/GHC. To be clear, what we are trying to do is install the Nix package manager (which is composed of many satellite programs like <code>nix-env</code>, <code>nix-shell</code>, etc.) so that we can develop Haskell programs with all the advantages that come with it.</p>
<p>For myself, I have several different Haskell projects, and I wanted to avoid redownloading and recompiling the same packages for each project’s Cabal sandbox environment. Using Nix, I still have the same Cabal sandboxes (one for each project root), but Nix allows all the different sandboxes to share the same packages if the versions and dependencies are the same. And plus, because the Nix store (where Nix stores everything — <code>/nix/store</code>) is independent of Arch’s <code>pacman</code> tool, there is no fear of conflict or things breaking whenever you upgrade Arch Linux’s own Haskell packages.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="use-the-nix-manual-to-install-nix">Use the Nix Manual to install Nix</h1>
<p>The <a href="http://nixos.org/nix/manual/">Nix manual</a> has up-to-date documentation on how to get Nix. When we say <em>Nix</em>, we are talking about the collection of console programs (with a <code>nix-</code> prefix in their names) that make up to form the Nix package management system — much like how <em>Git</em> is made up of smaller programs that work as a team. There is a <code>nix</code> package on the AUR, but I suggest simply following this guide.</p>
<p>The first step is to run the install script from the NixOS site (which hosts Nix and other related programs) as a normal user:</p>
<pre><code>$ bash &lt;(curl https://nixos.org/nix/install)</code></pre>
<p>. You will now have a directory called <code>/nix</code> in your system. This is where everything related to Nix will be stored. In addition, the script will create some hidden files under your user’s home directory with the <code>.nix-</code> prefix. The most important file for now is <code>~/.nix-profile</code>, because it links to a shell script that initializes the Nix environment (to bring in <code>nix-*</code> utilities into the current shell’s scope). You will get a message from the shell script to source this file, like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ . /home/l/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh</code></pre>
<p>. For me, I put the whole thing into an alias for my shell called <code>nix</code>, like this:</p>
<pre><code># somewhere in my ~/.zshrc
alias nix=&#39;. /home/l/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh&#39;</code></pre>
<p>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> So, whenever I want access to Nix utilities, I just type in <code>nix</code> and go on my merry way.</p>
<h1 id="install-cabal2nix-and-cabal">Install <code>cabal2nix</code> and <code>cabal</code></h1>
<p>Now, use your alias to enable Nix.</p>
<pre><code>$ nix</code></pre>
<p>You now have access to all the <code>nix-*</code> utilities that make up to provide the Nix package management system. You can list all Nix-packaged packages with <code>nix-env -qaP</code>. For us, we’re interested in the <code>cabal2nix</code> package. As of the time of this writing, it is called <code>nixpkgs.haskellPackages.cabal2nix</code>. However, the <code>haskellPackages</code> prefix refers to the old system that has been more or less deprecated as of <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.distributions.nixos/15513">January 2015</a>. We need to use the <code>haskellngPackages</code> (note the <code>ng</code>) prefix instead. I know that <code>nixpkgs.haskellngPackages.cabal2nix</code> isn’t listed with the <code>nix-env -qaP</code> command, but I believe that’s for legacy reasons. You can still install it! Let’s do that now:</p>
<pre><code>$ nix-env -iA nixpkgs.haskellngPackages.cabal2nix</code></pre>
<p>. This will give you the very useful <code>cabal2nix</code> binary which you can use to convert any <code>.cabal</code> file into something that Nix can understand! Let’s also install <code>cabal</code> for Nix:</p>
<pre><code>$ nix-env -iA nixpkgs.haskellngPackages.cabal-install</code></pre>
<p>. This will install <code>cabal</code> to <code>~/.nix-profile/bin/cabal</code>. This step is not really necessary if you have <code>cabal-install</code> already installed on the Arch Linux side with <code>pacman</code>. However, I still recommend it because</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>if you’re using Nix for Haskell development, there is no longer a need to use <code>cabal</code> outside of the Haskell/Nix development process;</li>
<li>it just makes sense to use the <code>cabal</code> package that comes from the same source tree as <code>cabal2nix</code> (i.e., from the same <code>haskellngPackages</code> set<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>); and</li>
<li>as of the time of this writing the <code>cabal-install</code> version from Nix packages set is newer than the Arch version.</li>
</ol>
<p>At the end of the day, your <code>cabal</code> binary should be writing to <code>~/.cabal</code> so take care to use one version and stick with it.</p>
<h1 id="nixify-your-project">Nixify your project</h1>
<h2 id="create-a-.cabal-file">Create a <code>.cabal</code> file</h2>
<p>If you haven’t done so already, create a Cabal file <code>your_project.cabal</code> in your project’s root folder to describe the dependencies in the traditional Haskell way. This step is mandatory!</p>
<h2 id="create-a-shell.nix-file">Create a <code>shell.nix</code> file</h2>
<p>Go to your project’s root folder that contains <code>your_project.cabal</code>, and do</p>
<pre><code>$ cabal2nix --shell . &gt; shell.nix</code></pre>
<p>. The actual syntax is <code>cabal2nix --shell path/to/cabal/file</code>, which prints out the contents of the <code>.nix</code> file to STDOUT. In the case above, we redirect it to a file named <code>shell.nix</code>. The name of this file is important because it is what <code>nix-shell</code> expects.</p>
<p>Now just invoke</p>
<pre><code>$ nix-shell</code></pre>
<p>and you’re set. You will be dropped into a <code>bash</code> instance that has knowledge of the Nix store. The first time you run <code>nix-shell</code>, Nix will identify any missing dependencies and install them for you. Because your project’s <code>shell.nix</code> file describes a Haskell project, <code>nix-shell</code> will install GHC along the way. So when it’s ready, you can start <code>ghci</code>. Because you installed <code>cabal2nix</code> earlier, you have access to <code>cabal</code> (i.e., <code>cabal</code> is a dependency of <code>cabal2nix</code>).</p>
<p>To build your binary just do <code>cabal build</code>! Personally I like to instantiate a Cabal sandbox with <code>cabal sandbox init</code> first, and then do <code>cabal configure</code>, <code>cabal repl</code>, <code>cabal build</code>, etc.</p>
<h1 id="local-dependencies">Local dependencies</h1>
<p>If you’re like me, you might have a Haskell library you wrote for yourself (let’s call it “Private Project X” (PPX)) which is not on Hackage. If you just want to build PPX on its own, you can use the same steps outlined above. But what if your other project depends on PPX?</p>
<p>The trick is to use <code>cabal2nix</code>, and to set up your <code>~/.nixpkgs</code> folder. You should already have <code>~/.nixpkgs</code> created by now as a result of installing Nix. Make a folder called <code>~/.nixpkgs/my-local-hs</code>. Now do</p>
<pre><code>$ cabal2nix path/to/ppx &gt; ~/.nixpkgs/my-local-hs/ppx.nix</code></pre>
<p>. This will create a Nix expression that can be used to build PPX with Nix. It’s like creating a PKGBUILD file. The next step is to create a <code>~/.nixpkgs/config.nix</code> file, as follows:</p>

          enableLibraryProfiling = true; });

        # Private package

<div class="raw-link">
<a  class="raw"  href= "/code/config.nix"  mimetype=text/plain > config.nix </a>
</div>
</div>
<p>. Now, invoke <code>cabal2nix --shell</code> for your other project that depends on PPX. When you invoke <code>nix-shell</code> for this other project, Nix should be able to resolve the dependency, based on the information you gave it in <code>~/.nixpkgs/config.nix</code>. That’s it!</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>I recommend trying Nix out for Haskell development, or just as a secondary package manager in general. Right now, everything “Just Works” and it’s a pleasure to see different Haskell projects re-use the same packages, even when they are Cabal-sandboxed, as long as you are doing everything within <code>nix-shell</code>.</p>
<p>Even though the title of this post suggests that this is an Arch Linux guide to Nix, there is nothing Arch-specific about it. You should be able to use the steps in this post for any Linux distribution.</p>
<p>Happy hacking!</p>
